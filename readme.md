**Uni**versal **S**yntax **T**ree.

***

**Unist** is the combination of three project, and more to come, which
are the summation of at least [two][first-retext-commit]
[years][first-remark-commit] of my work and the current epitome of that.

It’s basically a system for processing input: parsing it into a syntax tree,
transforming it by plug-ins, and compiling the tree to something else.

This document explains some terminology relating to [**retext**][retext],
[**remark**][remark], [**hast**][hast], and their related projects.

## Unist nodes

See [**nlcst**][nlcst] for more information on **retext** nodes,
[**mdast**][mdast] for information on **remark** nodes, and
[`hast#nodes`][hast-nodes] for information on **hast** nodes.

Subsets of Unist can define new properties on new nodes, and plug-ins
and utilities can define new [`data`][data] properties on nodes.  But,
the values on those properties **must** be JSON values: `string`,
`number`, `object`, `array`, `true`, `false`, or `null`.  This means
that the syntax tree should be able to be converted to and from JSON
and produce the same tree.  For example, in JavaScript, a tree should
be able to be passed through `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(tree))` and
result in the same values.

### `Node`

Node represents any unit in the Unist hierarchy.  It is an abstract
class.  Interfaces inheriting from **Node** must have a `type` property,
and may have `data` or `location` properties. `type`s are defined by
their namespace.

Subsets of Unist are allowed to define properties on interfaces which
subclass Unist’s abstract interfaces.  For example, [mdast][] defines
a `link` node (subclassing [Parent][]) with a `url` property.

```idl
interface Node {
  type: string;
  data: Data?;
  position: Location?;
}
```

#### `Data`

Data represents data associated with any node.  `Data` is a scope for
plug-ins to store any information.  For example, [`remark-html`][remark-html]
uses `htmlAttributes` to let other plug-ins specify attributes added
to the compiled HTML element.

```idl
interface Data { }
```

#### `Location`

**Location** references a location of a node in a **Unist** file.
If a location is not applicable, the location must be omitted.
**Location** consists of a `start` and end `position`. And, if
relevant, an `indent` property.

```idl
interface Location {
  start: Position;
  end: Position;
  indent: [uint32 >= 1]?;
}
```

#### `Position`

**Position** contains `line` and `column` set to a (1-based) integer
referencing a position in a **Unist** file.  An `offset` (0-based)
may be used.

```idl
interface Position {
  line: uint32 >= 1;
  column: uint32 >= 1;
  offset: uint32 >= 0?;
}
```

### `Parent`

Nodes containing child nodes inherit the **Parent** ([**Node**](#node))
abstract interface.

```idl
interface Parent <: Node {
    children: [Node];
}
```

### `Text`

Nodes containing a value inherit the **Text** ([**Node**](#node))
abstract interface.

```idl
interface Text <: Node {
    value: string;
}
```

## Unist files

**Unist files** are virtual files (such as [**vfile**][vfile])
representing content at a certain location.  They are not limited to
existing files.  Neither are they limited to the file-system only.

## Unist utilities

**Unist utilities** are function which work with **unist nodes** or **unist
files**, agnostic of **remark**, **retext**, or **hast**.

A list of **VFile**-related utilities can be found at [**vfile**][vfile].
