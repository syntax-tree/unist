**Uni**versal **S**yntax **T**ree.

* * *

**unist** is a specification for syntax trees.
It has a big [ecosystem of utilities][list-of-utilities] in JavaScript for
working with these trees.
It’s implemented by several other specifications.

This document may not be released.
See [releases][] for released documents.
The latest released version is [`2.0.0`][release].

## Introduction

This document defines a general-purpose format for syntax trees.
Development of unist started in July 2015.
This specification is written in a [Web IDL][webidl]-like grammar.

### Syntax tree

Syntax trees are representations of source code or even natural language.
These trees are abstractions that make it possible to analyse, transform, and
generate code.

Syntax trees [come in two flavours][abstract-vs-concrete-trees]:

*   **concrete syntax trees**: structures that represent every detail (such as
    white-space in white-space insensitive languages)
*   **abstract syntax trees**: structures that only represent details relating
    to the syntactic structure of code (such as ignoring whether a double or
    single quote was used in languages that support both, such as JavaScript).

This specification can express both abstract and concrete syntax trees.

### Where this specification fits

unist is not intended to be self-sufficient.
Instead, it is expected that other specifications implement unist and extend it
to express language specific nodes.
For example, see projects such as [**mdast**][mdast] (for Markdown),
[**hast**][hast] (for HTML), and [**nlcst**][nlcst] (for natural language).

unist relates to [JSON][] in that compliant syntax trees can be expressed
completely in JSON.
However, unist is not limited to JSON and can be expressed in other data
formats, such as [XML][].

unist relates to [JavaScript][] in that it has a rich [ecosystem of
utilities][list-of-utilities] for working with compliant syntax trees in
JavaScript.
The five most used utilities combined are downloaded thirty million times each
month.
However, unist is not limited to JavaScript and can be used in other programming
languages.

unist relates to the [unified][], [remark][], [rehype][], and [retext][]
projects in that unist syntax trees are used throughout their ecosystems.

unist relates to the [vfile][] project in that it accepts unist nodes for its
message store, and that vfile can be a source [*file*][term-file] of a syntax
tree.

## Nodes

Syntactic units in unist syntax trees are called nodes, and implement the
[**Node**][dfn-node] interface.

### `Node`

```idl
interface Node {
  type: string
  data: Data?
  position: Position?
}
```

The `type` field is a non-empty string representing the variant of a node.
This field can be used to determine the [*type*][term-type] a node implements.

The `data` field represents information from the ecosystem.
The value of the `data` field implements the [**Data**][dfn-data] interface.

The `position` field represents the location of a node in a source document.
The value of the `position` field implements the [**Position**][dfn-position]
interface.
The `position` field must not be present if a node is
[*generated*][term-generated].

Specifications implementing unist are encouraged to define more fields.
Ecosystems can define fields on [**Data**][dfn-data].

Any value in unist **must** be expressible in JSON values: `string`, `number`,
`object`, `array`, `true`, `false`, or `null`.
This means that the syntax tree should be able to be converted to and from JSON
and produce the same tree.
For example, in JavaScript, a tree can be passed through
`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(tree))` and result in the same tree.

#### `Position`

```idl
interface Position {
  start: Point
  end: Point
  indent: [number >= 1]?
}
```

**Position** represents the location of a node in a source [*file*][term-file].

The `start` field of **Position** represents the place of the first character of
the parsed source region.
The `end` field of **Position** represents the place of the first character
after the parsed source region, whether it exists or not.
The value of the `start` and `end` fields implement the [**Point**][dfn-point]
interface.

The `indent` field of **Position** represents the start column at each index
(plus start line) in the source region, for elements that span multiple lines.

If the syntactic unit represented by a node is not present in the source
[*file*][term-file] at the time of parsing, the node is said to be
[*generated*][term-generated] and it must not have positional information.

For example, if the following value was represented as unist:

```markdown
alpha
bravo
```

…the first word (`alpha`) would start at line `1`, column `1`, offset `0`, and
end at line `1`, column `6`, offset `5`.
The line feed would start at line `1`, column `6`, offset `5`, and end at line
`2`, column `1`, offset `6`.
The last word (`bravo`) would start at line `2`, column `1`, offset `6`, and end
at line `2`, column `6`, offset `11`.

#### `Point`

```idl
interface Point {
  line: number >= 1
  column: number >= 1
  offset: number >= 0?
}
```

**Point** represents one place in a source [*file*][term-file].

The `line` field (1-indexed integer) represents a line in a source file.
The `column` field (1-indexed integer) represents a column in a source file.
The `offset` field (0-indexed integer) represents a character in a source file.

The term character means a (UTF-16) code unit which is defined in the
[Web IDL][webidl] specification.

#### `Data`

```idl
interface Data { }
```

**Data** represents information associated by the ecosystem with the node.

This space is guaranteed to never be specified by unist or specifications
implementing unist.

### `Parent`

```idl
interface Parent <: Node {
  children: [Node]
}
```

Nodes containing other nodes (said to be [*children*][term-child]) extend the
abstract interface **Parent** ([**Node**][dfn-node]).

The `children` field is a list representing the children of a node.

### `Literal`

```idl
interface Literal <: Node {
  value: any
}
```

Nodes containing a value extend the abstract interface **Literal**
([**Node**][dfn-node]).

The `value` field can contain any value.

## Glossary

###### Tree

A **tree** is a node and all of its [*descendants*][term-descendant] (if any).

###### Child

Node X is **child** of node Y, if Y’s `children` include X.

###### Parent

Node X is **parent** of node Y, if Y is a [*child*][term-child] of X.

###### Index

The **index** of a [*child*][term-child] is its number of preceding
[*siblings*][term-sibling], or `0` if it has none.

###### Sibling

Node X is a **sibling** of node Y, if X and Y have the same
[*parent*][term-parent] (if any).

The **previous sibling** of a [*child*][term-child] is its **sibling** at its
[*index*][term-index] minus 1.

The **next sibling** of a [*child*][term-child] is its **sibling** at its
[*index*][term-index] plus 1.

###### Root

The **root** of a node is itself, if without [*parent*][term-parent], or the
**root** of its [*parent*][term-parent].

The **root** of a [*tree*][term-tree] is any node in that [*tree*][term-tree]
without [*parent*][term-parent].

###### Descendant

Node X is **descendant** of node Y, if X is a [*child*][term-child] of Y, or if
X is a [*child*][term-child] of node Z that is a **descendant** of Y.

An **inclusive descendant** is a node or one of its **descendants**.

###### Ancestor

Node X is an **ancestor** of node Y, if Y is a [*descendant*][term-descendant]
of X.

An **inclusive ancestor** is a node or one of its **ancestors**.

###### Head

The **head** of a node is its first [*child*][term-child] (if any).

###### Tail

The **tail** of a node is its last [*child*][term-child] (if any).

###### Leaf

A **leaf** is a node with no [*children*][term-child].

###### Branch

A **branch** is a node with one or more [*children*][term-child].

###### Generated

A node is **generated** if it does not have [*positional
information*][term-positional-info].

###### Type

The **type** of a node is the value of its `type` field.

###### Positional information

The **positional information** of a node is the value of its `position` field.

###### File

A **file** is a source document that represents the original file that was
parsed to produce the syntax tree.
[*Positional information*][term-positional-info] represents the place of a node
in this file.
Files are provided by the host environment and not defined by unist.

For example, see projects such as [**vfile**][vfile].

###### Preorder

In **preorder** (**NLR**) is [depth-first][traversal-depth] [tree
traversal][traversal] that performs the following steps for each node *N*:

1.  **N**: visit *N* itself
2.  **L**: traverse [*head*][term-head] (then its *next sibling*, recursively
    moving forward until reaching *tail*)
3.  **R**: traverse [*tail*][term-tail]

###### Postorder

In **postorder** (**LRN**) is [depth-first][traversal-depth] [tree
traversal][traversal] that performs the following steps for each node *N*:

1.  **L**: traverse [*head*][term-head] (then its *next sibling*, recursively
    moving forward until reaching *tail*)
2.  **R**: traverse [*tail*][term-tail]
3.  **N**: visit *N* itself

###### Enter

**Enter** is a step right before other steps performed on a given node *N* when
[**traversing**][traversal] a tree.

For example, when performing *preorder* traversal, **enter** is the first step
taken, right before visiting *N* itself.

###### Exit

**Exit** is a step right after other steps performed on a given node *N* when
[**traversing**][traversal] a tree.

For example, when performing *preorder* traversal, **exit** is the last step
taken, right after traversing the [*tail*][term-tail] of *N*.

## Tree traversal

**Tree traversal** is a common task when working with a [*tree*][term-tree] to
search it.
Tree traversal is typically either *breadth-first* or *depth-first*.

In the following examples, we’ll work with this tree:

```ascii
                 +---+
                 | A |
                 +-+-+
                   |
             +-----+-----+
             |           |
           +-+-+       +-+-+
           | B |       | F |
           +-+-+       +-+-+
             |           |
    +-----+--+--+        |
    |     |     |        |
  +-+-+ +-+-+ +-+-+    +-+-+
  | C | | D | | E |    | G |
  +---+ +---+ +---+    +---+
```

###### Breadth-first traversal

**Breadth-first traversal** is visiting a node and all its
[*siblings*][term-sibling] to broaden the search at that level, before
traversing [*children*][term-child].

For the syntax tree defined in the diagram, a breadth-first traversal first
searches the root of the tree (**A**), then its children (**B** and **F**), then
their children (**C**, **D**, **E**, and **G**).

###### Depth-first traversal

Alternatively, and more commonly, **depth-first traversal** is used.
The search is first deepened, by traversing [*children*][term-child], before
traversing [*siblings*][term-sibling].

For the syntax tree defined in the diagram, a depth-first traversal first
searches the root of the tree (**A**), then one of its children (**B** or
**F**), then their children (**C**, **D**, and **E**, or **G**).

For a given node *N* with [*children*][term-child], a **depth-first traversal**
performs three steps, simplified to only binary trees (every node has
[*head*][term-head] and [*tail*][term-tail], but no other children):

*   **N**: visit *N* itself
*   **L**: traverse [*head*][term-head]
*   **R**: traverse [*tail*][term-tail]

These steps can be done in any order, but for non-binary trees, **L** and **R**
occur together.
If **L** is done before **R**, the traversal is called *left-to-right*
traversal, otherwise it is called *right-to-left* traversal.
In the case of non-binary trees, the other children between *head* and *tail*
are processed in that order as well, so for *left-to-right* traversal, first
*head* is traversed (**L**), then its *next sibling* is traversed, etcetera,
until finally *tail* (**R**) is traversed.

Because **L** and **R** occur together for non-binary trees, we can produce four
types of orders: NLR, NRL, LRN, RLN.

NLR and LRN (the two *left-to-right* traversal options) are most commonly used
and respectively named [*preorder*][term-preorder] and
[*postorder*][term-postorder].

For the syntax tree defined in the diagram, *preorder* and *postorder* traversal
thus first search the root of the tree (**A**), then its head (**B**), then its
children from left-to-right (**C**, **D**, and then **E**).
After all [*descendants*][term-descendant] of **B** are traversed, its next
sibling (**F**) is traversed and then finally its only child (**G**).
